## EDEN Compositions <!--- Repository name with short description of the repo and, if available, link to the wiki -->

A collection of various EDEN editor compositions for Arma 3.

### How it works
Our standard player factions (`reference`) and adaptation modules (`reference-adaptations`) are collectively created and published by the CNTO Mission Making Team. You can download the latest composition releases either directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/CntoDev/compositions/releases) or alternatively by subscribing to our [Steam Workshop collection](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2421823024).

If you download the GitHub release manually, extract the compositions into your `compositions` directory in your Arma 3 profile:

```
C:\Users\YourWindowsUser\Documents\Arma 3\compositions
```
or if you have a non-default Arma 3 profile:
```
C:\Users\YourWindowsUser\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\YourProfileName\compositions
```

Additional per-author compositions not included in our standard releases are contained in the supplementary directories `Misc Compositions` and `custom factions`. You can download these manually on GitHub: green `Code` button / `Download ZIP`


For detailed information regarding setup, maintenance and use of the EDEN Compositions please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/CntoDev/compositions/wiki).
